The Chrysalis. It reimagines the "matrix" concept through a biomechanical structure, where transparent butterfly wings interweave with a precision skeleton to envelop the user in a sense of security. Sitting within it feels like entering a "buffer zone" of human evolution. Here, biological boundaries co-exist deeply with mechanical structures. The user is no longer just a sitter, but the core logic of this precision instrument, completing a profound reconstruction of physical enhancement amidst sensory silence.
