In a future mechanical world constructed by precise algorithms, life hatches from metal eggshells, known as "Egg-born". They take on different forms as their skills awaken. However, an unknown force called "Algorithm Rift" is quietly spreading, distorting time and space, threatening the order of the entire mechanical world.

Curious egg-shaped robot Ado meets brave purple-haired mechanical repair engineer CY and her loyal agile mechanical cat Momo during his adventures. The three form the "Mechanical Expedition Team". They will travel through mysterious ancient ruins, the bizarre AI algorithm world, and even cross the boundaries of future and modern time and space to uncover the mystery of the origin of the "Egg-born" and explore the truth behind the "Algorithm Rift".

In this challenging adventure, Ado will continuously awaken new abilities, CY uses wisdom and mechanical skills, while Momo provides protection with keen perception. They will grow together and guard the world they cherish with unbreakable bonds.
