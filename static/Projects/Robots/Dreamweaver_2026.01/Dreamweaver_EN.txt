Dreamweaver Flying Robot is a non-contact flying robot focused on deep sleep optimization and respiratory health management. Through close-range hovering monitoring and multi-dimensional intervention, it achieves two core missions: "dream healing" and "snoring assistance". The product is suitable for home bedrooms, providing non-intrusive and private intelligent sleep guardianship for users of all ages.

2. Core Functions

A. Dream Healing and Sensory Guidance
Deep Monitoring: Uses ultrasonic and infrared technology for non-contact monitoring of brain wave trends, heart rate, and breathing rhythms.
Healing Field Guidance: When light sleep is detected, guides users into high-quality deep sleep through specific frequency vibrations, micro-light rhythms, or white noise.
Dream Guardian: When physiological fluctuations caused by nightmares (such as accelerated heartbeat) are detected, provides gentle emotional soothing.
Multi-dimensional Aromatherapy Intervention: Built-in micro aromatherapy module releases different scents according to sleep stages (such as lavender for sleep aid, cedar for stability), deeply participating in dream healing through olfaction.

B. Snoring Assistance Intervention
Precise Positioning: Real-time locks onto snoring sound sources and their frequency and intensity.
Position Induction: When heavy snoring is detected, induces users to adjust their position through directional airflow, slight physical disturbance, or specific audio to open the airway.
Health Warning: Remotely monitors blood oxygen saturation to prevent sleep apnea risks.

C. Dream Traceability and Statistics
Dream Review: After waking up, users can view "dream visualization snapshots" generated based on sleep waveforms through connected devices.
Sleep Report: Statistics on deep sleep duration, snoring frequency, and dream fluctuation curves, providing long-term sleep quality trend analysis.

D. Invisible Flight and Hovering
Extreme Silence: Silent propulsion system ensures operating noise below 20dB (falling leaf level volume).
Intelligent Obstacle Avoidance: Flexibly navigates through complex indoor environments (such as curtains, furniture) to ensure safe and collision-free operation.

3. Interactive System
The eye screen is the robot's physiological state feedback window, intuitively displaying monitoring logic:
-Eye Form Function State Back-end Logic
Pure black dot guardian monitoring indicates stable breathing, with the system in low-power background monitoring state.
-Star eyes dream healing captures beautiful dream signals, releases healing frequencies and aromatherapy, enhancing deep sleep.
-Positive crescent eye soothing takes effect when snoring is relieved and breathing returns to normal, with the system giving "soothing" feedback.
-Reverse crescent eye emergency intervention detects heavy snoring or shortness of breath caused by nightmares, and is forcibly intervening.
