Core Image: Warm Fur Ball / Electronic Bodyguard / Invisible Guardian

Single people need their own security管家！It looks like just a warm and sticky "oatmeal fur ball" on the outside, but it's actually the most vigilant "electronic bodyguard" in the house!

Hardcore settings, really recommend every single person to understand:

1. Invisible Patrol, it's a "movable monitoring"
2. It's a ball, but the base is very stable
Hidden omnidirectional power base at the bottom! It looks like it's sliding quietly, but it's actually very stable. Suitable for cat owners' violent anti-scratch woven replaceable外套.
3. The "Last Line of Defense" Behind the Door
Its smartest feature is the automatic charging system. Silent guardian at the door at night, using highly sensitive sensors to monitor movements outside the door.
4. "Personal管家" for Elderly Living Alone
If it's for elderly people at home, it can monitor their movements, enable intercom anytime and anywhere, and even actively search for people.
5. Intelligent Early Warning:
Simulated Male Voice: Loudly question "Who's outside?", creating the illusion that someone is home.
Flashing Red Light: Star pupil flashes at high frequency, psychologically deterring intruders.
6. Extreme Tracking
Omnidirectional Follow-up: Utilizes omnidirectional wheels to drift flexibly, firmly locking onto the intruder's face.
Evidence Cloud Upload: Even if the ball is destroyed, the evidence has already been uploaded in real time.
7. Automatic Emergency Call
Fall Detection: When it detects an elderly person falling or hears "help", it immediately dials the emergency number and starts video.
