ETHA is an all-in-one desktop digital companion that integrates minimalist transmission, intelligent storage, and emotional healing. It breaks device barriers through bionic interaction, transforming dull data flow into a life-like "ingestion and excretion" ritual.

Anthropomorphic Physical Transmission: ETHA concretizes invisible data streams through simulating "swallowing" and "spitting" bionic actions, giving file storage unique interactive ritual sense.

Full-platform Compatibility Solution: Provides multi-dimensional connection protocols for cross-device transmission pain points. Android/HarmonyOS/iPhone: Activates transmission protocols through NFC tag touch, using Wi-Fi Direct for high-speed direct connection.

Through anthropomorphic interaction design, ETHA makes data transmission vivid and interesting, adding warmth and emotion to digital life.
