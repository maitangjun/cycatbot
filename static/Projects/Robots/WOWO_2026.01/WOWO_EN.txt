WOWO (Wo-wo) — Global Rehabilitation Partner

1. Core Product Philosophy: Heart-Sync™ (Heart Synchronization)
WOWO is not just a robot, WOWO is the sound of heartbeat, it's the bridge connecting medical monitoring with children's psychology. Through the transmission of "life rhythm", it transforms the cold rehabilitation process into warm companionship.
Brand Slogan: Heartbeat by Beat, We Smile Together.
Core Values: Borderless care, visualized vitality, educational and entertaining rehabilitation.

2. Deep Vital Signs Dashboard (Clinical Dashboard)
Heartbeat Detection, Blood Oxygen Saturation (SpO2), Sleep Quality Tracking, Body Temperature Trend Warning
Remote Pulse Sensing: Using millimeter-wave radar integrated in the head, WOWO acts like a mirror, capturing the ups and downs of children's hearts from a distance.
Stethoscope-level Sound Field: It transforms the collected weak heart sounds into rhythmic "WOWO language" that children can hear through high-fidelity sound chambers. When children hold it, it's like holding another healthy version of themselves.

3. Health Care Medical Intervention (Enhanced Medical Capability)
Rehabilitation Guidance: After WOWO puts on different costumes (such as wizard, superhero), it guides children to perform breathing training or physical exercise through the speed of heartbeat rhythm (for example: grasping blocks following the heartbeat rhythm).
Comprehensive Vital Signs Dashboard: Monitoring includes not only heartbeat, but also blood oxygen trends, body temperature fluctuations, and nighttime sleep apnea detection.
Smart Medical Accessories: Through magnetic suction cane, doctors can access the "heart sound history" recorded by WOWO as original reference basis for clinical diagnosis.

4. Characterized Dress-up Interaction (Enhanced Playfulness)
Halloween Costume: At this time, the heartbeat sound will have a mysterious bass rhythm, accompanied by purple heart flashing, accompanying children through the festival.
Costume is Function: Each costume represents a medical mode. For example, in "nurse uniform" mode, the heartbeat sound will be more soothing and calming, assisting in medication or nebulization treatment.
