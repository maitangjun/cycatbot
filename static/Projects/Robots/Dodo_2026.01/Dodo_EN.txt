Dodo (Doudou) is a supersensory AI healing doll positioned as a "full-age emotional container". It's not just a talking toy, but a new family member that can hold fragments of thoughts, dissolve negative energy, and simulate life body temperature.

▫️ Cloud-feeling rabbit velvet | Feels like soft and sticky daifuku
▫️ Constant temperature 38.5°C hand warmer | Instant healing when reaching in
▫️ Suspended dreamy eyes | Eyes that breathe, emotions conveyed through eyes
▫️ Humorous AI soul | Your late-night talk show partner

AI Soul: Humorous "Late Night Talk Show"
Dodo's brain doesn't follow the "AI customer service" route, it's a comedian who understands memes, can complain, and empathize.

Personality Setting: Warm but slightly mischievous "emotional catcher".

Communication Logic: It will record the fragments you say to it during the day. It has short-term memory (conversation context) and long-term memory (your living habits, family members).

Companion Function: At night when you put your hands in its pockets, it will organize the day's records into a talk show summary. You can also walk with Doudou while keeping your hands in its pockets, and the pockets will have warmth, providing warm companionship when you need it.

Example: "Doudou collected your three sighs and the guilt of eating fried chicken today. That boss really needs to take a course in human communication, but your final comeback was very elegant. Tonight I will 'delete' these unhappiness from my pocket, and you just need to have good dreams."
