Rest Buddy - The "Weak" Force of Nighttime Guardianship

Brand Vision: Rest Buddy is committed to reshaping the sensory security of the night through "weak AI" companionship logic, allowing every bit of loneliness and anxiety to be healed in silent physical guardianship.

1. Core Philosophy: Less is More
Rest Buddy is not born for "conversation" or "task execution". It abandons cumbersome screens and high-frequency social attributes, adhering to the companionship principle of "non-disturbance". It is more like a silent coordinate with vital signs, providing users with the purest and most primitive feedback in the darkness.

2. Original Interaction: Sensory Resonance System
Low-frequency Purring Interaction: Rest Buddy uses biological instinct-style "purring" instead of language communication. Triggered by calling or touching, it automatically shuts down after 3-5 minutes of silence, ensuring users naturally fall asleep in peace.

Vital Signs Simulation: Built-in precision vibration module simulates stable heartbeat and breathing sensations of adults. It soothes loneliness through physical resonance and alleviates anxiety of those who are timid at night and easily startled awake.

Healing Light Language: The eyes use full-spectrum extremely weak light. It automatically turns off when falling asleep, ensuring absolute darkness; when getting up at night, it gently turns on when called, providing visual support.

3. Support Structure: Ergonomics Born for "Sleep"
Rest Buddy is not just a pillow, it's an interactive sleeping posture aid. Its streamlined design is based on human body pressure distribution simulation, aiming to correct users' various sleeping posture burdens at night. Whether filling neck gaps, supporting the waist, or acting as leg pressure buffer, Rest Buddy's full product line is committed to allowing muscles to achieve complete physical relaxation in companionship.

4. Brand System: Full-scenario Deep Companionship
Rest Buddy will continuously develop various weak companionship products for different segmented groups (such as elderly, single youth, dream-anxious individuals) based on ergonomics, building a complete nighttime protection matrix.
