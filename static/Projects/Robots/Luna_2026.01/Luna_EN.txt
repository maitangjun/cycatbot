"Luna" means moon in Latin. The moon is culturally associated with feminine power, delicate emotions, and guardianship. For women busy in workplace and life, it's not as dazzling as the sun, but quietly and gently accompanies at night, giving a psychological hint of an "emotional safe haven."

Luna Design Logic: From "Mechanical" to "Biological Sense"

Material "Synesthesia" Logic (Sensory Warmth)
From "Hard" to "Tough": Abandoned high-gloss plastics and cold metals. I envision Luna using a skin-like biological silica gel or frosted ceramic coating.
Removing Screen Glare: This is a key decision. By embedding the display interface below translucent material (hidden dot matrix or soft light screen), light becomes soft through refraction. This "light penetrating under skin" mimics biological flush, warmer than harsh LCD screens.

Form "Emotional Resonance" Logic (Emotional Geometry)
Tumbler Structure: Luna's center of gravity is low. This slightly "clumsy" roundness can evoke human protective instincts (neoteny effect).
Minimalist Anthropomorphic Treatment: It has no complex facial features, only a pair of talking "emoticons".
Through simplification, users project their emotions onto it - when you're happy, you feel it's smiling; when you're sad, you feel it's quietly accompanying you.
