In the concrete jungle of the city, have we lost the ant-like sensitivity to perceive? "YI" is an experiment about biological instinct and mechanical interaction. We extracted the most sophisticated communication organ in nature - the ant's antennae, and transformed it into a warm coordinate in public space.

The Ant of Perception
Antennae are the universal key for ants to explore the world. "YI" captures this subtle trembling and swinging, transforming originally silent public facilities into living beings with "communication language".

The Antenna of Emotion
Made of shape memory alloy, the bionic antennae can capture the "pulse" of the environment in real time. When you sit down tired, the antennae gently bow to greet you - that's the warmest welcome from mechanical life to humans.

Walking Life, Touching Theater
"YI" is a performance-level dynamic device with a "social switch". When you turn on the interactive command, it transforms from a static seat into a six-legged walking creature. It carries people rhythmically through the space, with antennae swinging and changing colors in real time with body displacement, transforming the originally private sitting into a flowing street art.
